# Linear-Stage-motor-
The goal of this project was to design and build a functional prototype of a flexure system driven by a linear motor. The linear motor design can be described as a u-channel air-core permanent magnet linear synchronous motor. The displacement of the flexure was specified at +/- 10 mm. To implement the control strategy and to power the linear motor a three-phase amplifier and power supply was built with signal input from a National Instruments myRIO. The feedback for the design is provided by a Mitutoyo optical encoder that outputs a quadrature signal which is interpolated, converted to a digital signal then read by the myRIO.
